# Enhancing-FluView-Dashboard-for-User-Centric-Navigation
The project involves creating a database that focuses on healthcare data related to flu cases. The goal is to develop a system where users can easily determine which areas to avoid during a road trip across the United States.
The approach includes combining data from clinical labs and public health labs into a single table for both state and national data. This combined table would include information such as total positives, total patients, and the percentage of positive flu cases. By comparing the percentage of positive flu cases from different states to the national average, users can gain insights into the prevalence of the flu in specific regions.
Overall, the project proposal aims to create a database that enables users to make informed decisions about their travel plans, considering the health risks associated with flu cases in different areas across the United States.

Data was sourced from the CDC's flu view tracker by downloading national and state flu tracking data for all years
